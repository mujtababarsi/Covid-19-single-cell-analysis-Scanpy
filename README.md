# Covid-19-single-cell-analysis-Scanpy
scRNA-seq anlysis using Scanpy for six PBMC samples
this workflow based on tutorial [NBIS](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/52011/pages/exercises?module_item_id=247565) with a set of six PBMC 10x datasets from 3 covid-19 patients and 3 healthy controls, the samples have been subsampled to 1500 cells per sample.
## The workflow explores steps of scRNA-seq downstream analysis 
1. Quality Control	
2. Dimensionality reduction	
3. Data integration	
4.Clustering
5. Differential expression	
6. Celltype prediction
